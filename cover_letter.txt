Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at your esteemed organization. As an aspiring software engineer with a diverse background in computer science and a passion for innovation, I am eager to contribute my skills and experiences to your dynamic team.

My journey into the world of computer science began in the 5th grade, when I enrolled in an advanced math and computer science class. It was during this formative period that I was introduced to the fascinating world of data structures and algorithms. This early exposure ignited my curiosity, leading me to explore various programming languages, including Rust, C++, and Python, on my own.

In addition to my academic endeavors, I have actively pursued opportunities to apply and expand my knowledge. I have been involved in programming competitions, collaborated on team projects, and made significant contributions to open-source initiatives. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving skills, fostered collaboration, and exposed me to the ever-evolving landscape of software development.

One of my significant contributions includes active participation in an open-source project within the Near Protocol ecosystem. Leveraging the power of Rust and Python, I have worked collaboratively on this project to enhance the Near Protocol's capabilities. My contributions have been focused on data streaming, improving type structure, and developing user-friendly features. This experience has not only sharpened my programming skills but has also given me valuable insights into the collaborative nature of open-source development.

The description of your software engineer position and your company's commitment to innovation aligns seamlessly with my aspirations and skills. I am eager to join a team that shares my passion for creating efficient, high-quality software solutions.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and enthusiasm for software engineering can contribute to Google's mission. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Ivan Frolov
