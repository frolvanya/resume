\section{\textsc{Summary}}

I am goal oriented and a fast learner.
During my school education I participated and won numerous of individual and team contests.
I also attended IT classes after classes to get base knowledge about data structure, such as graphs, binary trees, hashmaps, hashsets etc. 
Furthermore, during my last educational year I worked hard on Minor Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. 
My topic was “development of a document verification system”. 
From this experience, I learned to quickly receive information from not the most common sources, as well as to structure and express my thoughts. 
In the past two years I honed Python and Rust skill on LeetCode and CodeWars and wrote a lot of pet projects to learn more frameworks and tools.
