\section{\textsc{Summary}}

I am goal oriented and a fast learner.
I participated and won numerous of individual and team contests using Rust such as ICPC.
I also attended IT classes to get basic knowledge about data structures, such as graphs, binary trees, hashmaps, hashsets etc. Based on the knowledge gained, I began to develop my own data structures in \href{https://github.com/frolvanya/load-testing-tool}{\textcolor{blue}{programs}} that helped me write strong code. 
Furthermore, I worked hard on Minor Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. 
My topic was “development of a document verification system”. 
From this experience, I learned quickly receive information from not the most common sources, as well as to structure and express my thoughts. 
In the past two years I honed Python and Rust skill on LeetCode and CodeWars and wrote a lot of pet projects to learn more frameworks and tools.
