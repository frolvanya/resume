\section{\textsc{Summary}}

\qquad My journey to Computer Science started in the 5th grade, where I studied in an advanced math and computer science class and learned a lot about data structures and algorithms, and later dove into learning different programming languages (Rust, C++, Python) and technologies on my own. My curiosity allowed me to participate in various programming competitions, team projects, and open source contributions. Seeking to use my existing skills and eagerness to learn further and implement new ideas in the development of new modern software by joining your team to expand my professional skills and gain valuable experience in the process of designing reliable software solutions.
